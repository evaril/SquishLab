# Install with no binary builds (compile everything locally)
sudo -u homeassistant /opt/homeassistant/venv/bin/pip install --no-binary=:all: homeassistant

# Or install with pre-compiled wheels only (faster, but may not have all packages)
sudo -u homeassistant /opt/homeassistant/venv/bin/pip install --only-binary=:all: homeassistant

# Or a hybrid approach (recommended)
sudo -u homeassistant /opt/homeassistant/venv/bin/pip install \
    --prefer-binary homeassistant
