# SquishLab Bridged VM Networking Configuration

## üîí Security Note: No dnsmasq Required

**Your security concern about dnsmasq is valid** - it has serious vulnerabilities (DNSpooq CVE-2020-25681-7, 2024 DNSSEC issues). 

**Good news: Bridged networks eliminate dnsmasq entirely:**
- ‚ùå NAT networks: Use libvirt's dnsmasq (security risk)
- ‚úÖ Bridged networks: VMs connect directly to physical network
- ‚úÖ DHCP from squishhq (192.168.72.1), not dnsmasq  
- ‚úÖ DNS from squishhq, systemd-resolved handles host resolution

## Current vs Target Architecture

**Current State (Isolated):**
```
VM (192.168.100.10) ‚Üí virbr1 ‚Üí squishlab NAT ‚Üí squishhq ‚Üí Internet
```

**Target State (Bridged):**
```
VM (192.168.72.x via DHCP) ‚Üí br0 ‚Üí squishlab ‚Üí squishhq ‚Üí ISP Router ‚Üí Internet
```

## Prerequisites Check & dnsmasq Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY NOTE**: dnsmasq has serious vulnerabilities (DNSpooq, recent 2024 CVEs). **Good news**: bridged networks do NOT require dnsmasq service running.

```bash
# Verify required packages (dnsmasq package may be needed as libvirt dependency)
pacman -Q iptables-nft bridge-utils

# Install if missing
sudo pacman -S iptables-nft bridge-utils

# dnsmasq package might be required for libvirt, but service should NOT run
# We'll disable the service to prevent security exposure
sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq
sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
```

**Why this works**: libvirt handles DHCP and DNS with dnsmasq, launching a separate instance for every virtual network - but **ONLY for NAT networks**. Bridged networks bypass dnsmasq entirely.

## Phase 1: Host Bridge Configuration (NetworkManager)

### 1.1: Identify Your Physical Interface
```bash
# Find your primary network interface
ip link show
nmcli device status

# Expected output should show your main interface (e.g., eno1, enp3s0, etc.)
```

### 1.2: Create Bridge with NetworkManager

$ sudo nmcli con add ifname br0 type bridge con-name br0

```bash
# Create the bridge
sudo nmcli con add ifname br0 type bridge con-name br0

# Add your physical interface as bridge slave (replace eno1 with your interface)
sudo nmcli con add type bridge-slave ifname eno1 master br0

# Disable STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) for better performance
sudo nmcli con modify br0 bridge.stp no

# Configure IPv4 DHCP (get IP from squishhq)
sudo nmcli con modify br0 ipv4.method auto

# Disable IPv6 as requested
sudo nmcli con modify br0 ipv6.method disabled
```

### 1.3: Activate Bridge Configuration
```bash
# Bring down existing connection (replace "Wired connection 1" with actual name)
sudo nmcli con down "Wired connection 1"

# Bring up the bridge
sudo nmcli con up br0

# Verify bridge is active and has IP from squishhq
nmcli

nmcli con show br0
```

## Phase 2: System-Level Bridge Optimization

### 2.1: Kernel Bridge Settings

For performance and security reasons, disable netfilter for bridges.

```bash
# Create bridge optimization config
sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-bridge.conf << 'EOF'
# Disable netfilter for bridges (performance)
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=0

# IPv6 disabled globally (as requested)
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
EOF

# Apply immediately
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-bridge.conf
```

### 2.2: udev Rules for Bridge Module
```bash
# Create udev rule to apply bridge settings when module loads
sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-bridge.rules << 'EOF'
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="module", KERNEL=="br_netfilter", RUN+="/usr/bin/sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-bridge.conf"
EOF
```

## Phase 3: systemd-resolved Configuration

### 3.1: Configure systemd-resolved

systemd-resolved will work out of the box with a network manager using /etc/resolv.conf.

```bash
# Create systemd-resolved configuration
sudo tee /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/squishlab.conf << 'EOF'
[Resolve]
# Let squishhq handle DNS resolution
DNS=192.168.72.1
FallbackDNS=149.112.112.11 9.9.9.11
Domains=~.
DNSSEC=no
DNSOverTLS=no
# Disable IPv6 DNS
IPv6=no
EOF

# Restart systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved

# Verify configuration
resolvectl status
```

### 3.2: NetworkManager Integration
```bash
# Ensure NetworkManager uses systemd-resolved
sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns.conf << 'EOF'
[main]
dns=systemd-resolved
EOF

# Restart NetworkManager
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

## Phase 4: libvirt Bridge Network

### 4.1: Create Host Bridge Network Definition

Create a bridge network device inside KVM.

```bash
# Create libvirt bridge network XML
cat > ~/host-bridge.xml << 'EOF'
<network>
  <name>host-bridge</name>
  <forward mode="bridge"/>
  <bridge name="br0"/>
</network>
EOF

# Define and start the network
virsh net-define ~/host-bridge.xml
virsh net-start host-bridge
virsh net-autostart host-bridge

# Verify the network
virsh net-list --all
```

### 4.2: Destroy/Replace Default Network
```bash
# Stop and remove default isolated network
virsh net-destroy default
virsh net-undefine defaultx

# Verify only host-bridge remains
virsh net-list --all
```

## Phase 5: VM Configuration Updates

### 5.1: Update VM Network Interface (virt-manager)
1. Open virt-manager
2. Edit your VM (windows10-clean)
3. Go to NIC device
4. Change "Network source" to "Virtual network 'host-bridge'"
5. Set "Device model" to "virtio"
6. Apply changes

### 5.2: Update VM Network Interface (XML/virsh)
```bash
# Get current VM configuration
virsh dumpxml windows10-clean > ~/vm-backup.xml

# Edit VM to use host-bridge
virsh edit windows10-clean

# Find the <interface> section and change to:
# <interface type='network'>
#   <source network='host-bridge'/>
#   <model type='virtio'/>
# </interface>
```

### 5.3: VM Guest Configuration
**In Windows VM:**
- Set network adapter to DHCP
- Disable IPv6 in network adapter properties
- DNS servers should be automatically assigned by squishhq

## Phase 6: Verification & Testing

### 6.1: Host Verification
```bash
# Verify bridge is working
brctl show
ip addr show br0

# Check NetworkManager status
nmcli con show br0

# Verify systemd-resolved
resolvectl status

# Test DNS resolution
nslookup google.com
```

### 6.2: VM Network Testing
```bash
# Start VM and verify network
virsh start windows10-clean

# Check VM gets IP in 192.168.72.x range (from squishhq DHCP)
# In Windows VM:
# - ipconfig /all
# - Should show IP: 192.168.72.x
# - Should show Gateway: 192.168.72.1 (squishhq)
# - Should show DNS: assigned by squishhq
```

### 6.3: Security Verification (No dnsmasq)
```bash
# Verify no dnsmasq processes running
ps aux | grep -v grep | grep dnsmasq
# Should return empty (no dnsmasq processes)

# Verify no dnsmasq listening on port 53
ss -tulpn | grep :53
# Should only show systemd-resolved on 127.0.0.53

# Verify libvirt bridge network has no dnsmasq
virsh net-info host-bridge
# Should show no DHCP range (relies on squishhq for DHCP)
```
```bash
# From squishlab host - test VM connectivity
ping [VM_IP_from_squishhq]

# From VM - test internet connectivity
# ping 8.8.8.8 (should work)
# nslookup google.com (should resolve via squishhq DNS)
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Bridge Issues
```bash
# Check bridge status
ip link show master br0
brctl show

# Restart networking if needed
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
sudo nmcli con up br0
```

### VM Not Getting DHCP
```bash
# Check libvirt network
virsh net-info host-bridge
virsh net-dhcp-leases host-bridge

# Restart VM networking
virsh destroy windows10-clean
virsh start windows10-clean
```

### DNS Resolution Problems
```bash
# Check systemd-resolved status
resolvectl status

# Test DNS directly
dig @192.168.72.1 google.com

# Restart DNS services
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# If issues occur, rollback to isolated network:
virsh net-destroy host-bridge
virsh net-undefine host-bridge

# Recreate default network
virsh net-start default
virsh net-autostart default

# Restore VM to use default network
virsh edit windows10-clean
# Change back to: <source network='default'/>
```

## Expected Final State

**Network Topology:**
```
