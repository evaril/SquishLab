Verify your download

Verify your download for security and integrity using the proper checksum and signature file. If there is a good signature from one of the Fedora keys, and the SHA256 checksum matches, then the download is valid.

    Download the checksum file and signature into the same directory as the image you downloaded.

    Import Fedora's GPG key(s)

    curl -O https://fedoraproject.org/fedora.gpg

    You can verify the details of the GPG key(s) here.

    Verify the signature file is valid

    gpgv --keyring ./fedora.gpg fedora-coreos-42.20250512.3.0-metal.x86_64.raw.xz.sig fedora-coreos-42.20250512.3.0-metal.x86_64.raw.xz

    Verify the checksum matches

    sha256sum --ignore-missing -c fedora-coreos-42.20250512.3.0-metal.x86_64.raw.xz-CHECKSUM

If the output states that the file is valid, then it's ready to use!
