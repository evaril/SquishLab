Perfect! I've enriched the existing framework mapping with the significant additional content from the second batch. The key enhancements include:

Major Additions:
Safety Gate Framework - 10+ critical safety checks before destructive operations
Comprehensive Validation - Multi-layer validation with specific error resolution
Production Error Handling - Backup-first operations with automatic rollback
Emergency Recovery - USB fallback and ESP rebuild capabilities
New Products Added:
Setup.VFIO/ - GTX 1070 passthrough automation with safety checks
Monitor.FullStatus/ - 15-category comprehensive system verification
Lock.BootSecurity/ - Direct UEFI boot with destructive operation gates
Work.TunnelMgmt/ - Production SSH tunnel management with validation
Fix.BootRepair/ - Emergency ESP recovery and reconstruction
Enhanced Patterns:
Source-of-truth architecture (/etc/kernel/cmdline as single source)
Progressive validation (input → local → network → SSH → remote)
Error categorization with specific resolution guidance
Idempotent operations safe to run multiple times
The framework now incorporates ~6000+ lines of functional code across 12+ source files, with production-grade safety, validation, and recovery systems. All content is mapped and ready for implementation phase.

Ready for the next batch or should we proceed to implementation?
